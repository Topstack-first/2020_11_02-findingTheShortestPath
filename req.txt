Hello, I am looking for a Masters student or 
a professional to help me with a SQL programming 
question. It involves recursive functions and 
"finding the shortest path". 
Please let me know if you are familiar with these 
topics and I can send you all the details. Thank you.

1) There must be a "view FUMAR_PATHS" 
which uses the distance formula to 
calculate the distance between each 
set of points (line 70,71 of code)   ------------------   complete

2) There must be a procedure called 
"GET_SHORTEST_FUMAR_PATH" which will 
output the result (line 74 to 80)    -------------------complete

3) The code must be inserted 
into the current file only 
where the comments are and 
not anywhere else (lines 82-83)      ------------------complete

4) Please include some comments 
explaining what the code does (line 94)  --------------complete

Once this is done. 
Then make a duplicate copy of the file, 
and we can do the remaining few changes 
on the duplicate copy

5) Make a procedure called 
"GENERATE_N_FUMAR_SITES (@siteCount int)" 
which creates @siteCount sites in the 
table instead of 4. So basically, 
this is now a funciton where the user 
can input how many sites he wants to be 
randomly generated. If user input 5, then 
5 random sites are generated. If user input 10, 
then 10 random sites are generated (Lines 98-99)  -------complete

6) validate that GET_SHORTEST_FUMAR_PATHS 
works according to the user input . 
So basically we must validate that when 
the user is inputting 5, then 5 sites 
are generated. (line 1000)                         ----------complete

7) In the comments, record how long it takes 
for a few different number of sites(line 101 to 102)

points 5 6 7 must be done on a copy of the 
.sql document -- not on the original
